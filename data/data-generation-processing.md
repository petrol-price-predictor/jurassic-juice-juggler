## About the petrol station market in Germany
---
- There are about 15.000 petrol stations in Germany as of 2022.
- The absolute number of stations is decreasing in the last 10 years.
- There is still a concentration process going on: corporations are buying smaller chains and independents. Sometimes they close their recently bought stations to open new (usually bigger ones).

### Corporations & Brands

Corporations are said to control their prices for all their stations centrally. They represent **61 % of the petrol stations in Germany**.

|Corporation    | Brands            |Station Share |
|---------------|-------------------|------|
| BP            | Aral, BP          | 16 % |
| Shell plc     | Shell             | 14 % | 
| TotalEnergies | Total, ELAN, FINA | 8 %  |
| ExxonMobil    | Esso              | 7 %  |
| Phillips 66   | Jet               | 6 %  |
| PKN Orlen     | Orlen, Star       | 4 %  |
| Eni           | Agip              | 3 %  |
| Tamoil        | HEM               | 3 %  |


### Independent Brands
These brands are more like interest groups that do buying and marketing together, but are not centrally pushing price changes to the stations.

The biggest independent station are visible as as _AVIA_ and _bft_ 

| Independent | Station Share |
|-------------|-------|
| bft         | 7 %   |
| AVIA        | 6 %   |

The remaining 26 % are smaller operators and single independent petrol stations.

## Data generation process
--- 
How a price is changed:
- Corporations and smaller chains are said to **control their prices centrally** for all their stations.
- Various journalistic articles reproduce the view that **Aral and Shell are usually the first to start a new round of prices changes**. The other operators are following them.
- It's only for the really small operators and the independents where the station is owned by the same people who operate it. There, a decision to change the price is made only for a single petrol station.

What happens afterwards
- Station operators are obliged to report price changes to the MTS-K within a 5 minute time frame 


## Data processing
---
- Petrol stations which sold less than 750.000 liters in the last 12 months (all fuel types combined) do not need to report their prices to the MTS-K.

- For most of the stations, it seems that it's the petrol station software that pushes prices changes automatically to the MTS-K

- **Keep in mind**: we pull data provided by tankerkönig.de - not necessarily a 1:1 copy of the original MTS-K data


### Open Questions
- How to correctly interpret the `...change` columns in the `*prices.csv` - especially the `3` value? This is probably tankerkönig-specific.
- What kind of processing / cleaning happens to the data before tankerkönig.de provides it through it's API and repo?

## Tankerkönig Q&A
A summary of questions we asked Tankerkönig and what answers we got:

|Our Question|Tankerkönig's Answer|
|------------|--------------------|
|**1. diesel-/e5-/e10change**: Are the flags coming from the MTS-K platfrom or does Tankerkönig generate them?|These flags are generated by Tankerkönig after every import from the MTS-K platform|
|**2. Longer periods without data**: We found periods of several hours without any price reports. At the end of the period nearly all stations report prices with the `3` flag. How to interpret this pattern? Is it an outage of the MTS-K platform or the Tankerkönig platform?|There are outages at the provider who is running the MTS-K servers where Tankerkönig pulls its data from. Mostly these outages are no longer than a few minutes, but recently there outages of up to 6 hours.|
|**3. Mass reports with identical timestamp**: At timestamp `2021-08-09 15:19:07+0200` We found a case where nearly all stations reported their prices but there was no huge period of missing data before. Do you know what happened there?|Most probably this was an outage on MTS-K side. It's also possible that it relates to a software update on our (Tankerkönig) side, but I can't track this down right now|
|**4. Availability of the MTS-K platform**: Generally speaking, what is your experience regarding the availability of the MTS-K platform?|see 2. - recent longer outages happened on May 10th for 6 hours and on April 24th for 4 hours|
