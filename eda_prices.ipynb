    "# Prices EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we're going to examine how time-series data is constructed and distributed. We know that gas stations in Germany are required to report any change in their petrol prices in (almost) real-time. This means that data isn't generated centrally but is decentralized across approximately 16,000 instances. We observe that the API creates some batched timestamps rather than a single timestamp for every observed price change, but this doesn't provide much help. We encounter three main issues with the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's not uniformly sampled, which means that not every timestamp represents each gas station. In fact, each timestamp includes only a relatively small number of price changes, although more than one.\n",
    "* Timestamps aren't equidistant, which is to be expected as gas stations can change their prices at will and at any time. Sometimes prices change 10 times per hour, and sometimes only once a day.\n",
    "* In addition to the irregular time-scale, there's no rule dictating when gas stations sell gas. They might be closed for an entire day, have varying opening hours, or never close at all. They might also run out of product and stop selling entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're trying to investigate the details of the outlined problems and find solutions to pre-process our data for a baseline model. Note that there are models capable of handling irregular data. We will explore these further down the line. However, in a first step, our goal is to resample the data as efficiently as possible and create a regular panel. To do this, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find reasonable time-bins for the report. If we make these too granular, the dataset will bloat exponentially, making it computationally unreasonable.\n",
    "* If the bins are too large, we lose too much information. Our goal is to observe and predict impulse responses from neighboring gas stations. Large bins would falsely imply that events are happening simultaneously, which they aren't, as the data generation process (DGP) is decentralized.\n",
    "* This process will create many sparse tables, which will need to be filled with the current prices of each gas station at each timestamp. These prices correspond to the last price the respective station set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially the last point is quite unfortunate but necessary for classical models or \"simpler\" ML models to handle the data. However, it doesn't really add any information that wasn't in the original dataset, yet it needs to be computed. Our goal is to find a model that can handle this irregular data without the need for resampling. One way to tackle this could be the creation of time distances as features, which we will also investigate in this notebook."
